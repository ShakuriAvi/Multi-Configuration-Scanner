# Multi-Configuration-Scanner
# Configuration 1: Weak Authentication Mechanisms
  * Compliance Category: Vulnerabilities
    Description: Implementing weak authentication mechanisms, such as plain text passwords or weak encryption algorithms, increases the risk of unauthorized access and credential theft.
    Detection: Monitor repository settings for the use of weak authentication mechanisms or password storage practices.
    Automatic Fix: Automatically enforce the use of strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication and password hashing, to enhance security.
# Configuration 2: Lack of Media Content Validation
  * Compliance Category: Media Protection
    Description: Not validating media content uploaded to repositories can lead to the upload of malicious or inappropriate content, posing security and reputational risks.
    Detection: Scan media files for known malware signatures or inappropriate content based on predefined criteria.
    Automatic Fix: Automatically validate media content uploaded to repositories using content analysis tools and block or flag suspicious content for further review.

# Configuration 3: Lack of Access Controls on Repository Configuration Files
  * Compliance Category: Access Control
    Description: Not implementing access controls on repository configuration files (e.g., .gitconfig, .gitignore) can lead to unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information.
    Detection: Monitor repository settings and permissions for inappropriate access to configuration files.
    Automatic Fix: Automatically apply access controls to repository configuration files based on user roles and permissions, restricting access to authorized users only.

# Configuration 4: Lack of Version Control
  * Compliance Category: Configuration Management
    Description: Not using version control for repositories increases the risk of data loss, unauthorized changes, and difficulty in tracking changes over time.
    Detection: Monitor repositories for the presence of version control systems or the absence of commit history.
    Automatic Fix: Automatically initialize version control systems (e.g., Git) for repositories without them and educate users on how to use version control effectively.

# Configuration 5: Lack of Change Management Processes
* Compliance Category: Configuration Management
  Description: Not implementing change management processes for repository modifications increases the risk of unauthorized or untracked changes, leading to instability and security vulnerabilities.
  Detection: Monitor repository activity for unauthorized modifications, deletions, or additions.
  Automatic Fix: Automatically enforce change management processes, such as requiring pull requests and code reviews, before allowing modifications to repositories.

Configuration: Lack of Version Control
Explanation for Non-Technical Users:
Version control is like having a time machine for your files. It allows you to track changes made to your documents or code over time, so you can see who made what changes and when. Imagine working on a group project where everyone is editing the same document. Without version control, it's easy to lose track of changes or accidentally overwrite someone else's work. Version control helps you avoid these problems by keeping a history of all changes and allowing you to revert to previous versions if needed.

Best Practice:
The best practice for configuration management, specifically version control, is to use a dedicated version control system like Git. This involves creating a repository for your project where you can track changes, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your files. Each time you make a change, you commit it to the repository with a descriptive message, allowing you to easily track changes over time.

Meaning of Configuration:
Configuration management, specifically version control, refers to the practice of systematically managing changes to documents, code, or other files. It involves using tools and processes to track changes, maintain a history of revisions, and coordinate collaboration among team members.

Risks of Not Implementing Version Control:
Without version control, it's difficult to track changes, collaborate effectively with team members, and ensure the integrity of your files. You risk overwriting important changes, losing track of who made what changes, and encountering conflicts when multiple people are working on the same files simultaneously.

Steps to Fix Manually:
Choose a Version Control System: Select a version control system like Git, which is widely used and well-supported.
Set Up a Repository: Create a repository for your project where you can store your files and track changes.
Commit Changes: Whenever you make changes to your files, commit them to the repository with a descriptive message explaining the changes.
Collaborate with Others: Share the repository with your team members and collaborate on files using branching, merging, and pull requests.
Regularly Update and Review: Regularly update your repository with the latest changes and review the commit history to track progress and identify any issues.
Impact of Changing Configuration on GitHub:
Implementing version control on GitHub improves collaboration, coordination, and tracking of changes within projects. It provides a centralized platform for managing files, tracking revisions, and facilitating collaboration among team members. Overall, it enhances efficiency, productivity, and the quality of work produced.

MITRE Attack Techniques Related to Version Control:
T1219: Remote Access Software: Attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in version control systems or gain unauthorized access to repositories to exfiltrate sensitive data, inject malicious code, or disrupt development processes. For example, if a repository is not properly secured, an attacker could gain access to sensitive source code or credentials stored within the repository, allowing them to compromise systems or launch further attacks. Implementing robust security measures, such as access controls, encryption, and monitoring, helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches through version control systems.

To run the project, you need pull the main, install the requirements file and add a cfg.py file (I will attach a picture below of how the file should look).

You need add a permission to your repository.
* About the Ptoject:
The project is based on the thread producer-consumer design pattern(although not with a queue, but I used a generator that provides tasks and some workers that pull and execute them when they are free). I also used Factory to support different types of files and add them without changing any code.  I kept the SOLID principles throughout the project with the help of inheritance and abstract classes. It was really nice to learn how to work with PR in front of Git using the PYGitHub library (we use AWS). My focus is on the design and working on a large scale. There are three algorithms I implemented in order to update the user whose configuration needs to be changed:
To begin with, I checked if one of the files contained an implementation of a secret variable in AWS. It causes damage to the company's systems and penetration of information. If it exists, I deleted the value of the variable.
The second, checking the connection to the system, whether unauthorized aliens are contained within authorized aliens. If so, I deleted it from the list. 
The third one is a little more complex, I used a library that checks requirements files, if one of the values in the library is incorrect, it gives suggestions for optimization. In this case, I didn't have time to delve deeper and understand how I change a version in the requirements, but I created a new branch and indicated to the user what the recommendations are regarding the versions.
